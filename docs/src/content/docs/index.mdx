  <Card title="Isolated Environments" icon="laptop">
    Each project runs in its own Docker island, preventing dependency conflicts and keeping your host system clean. Islands persist between sessions and can be configured to auto-restart.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reproducible Builds" icon="approve-check">
    Deterministic lock files with SHA-256 checksums pin every package version, registry, and apt source. Run `coderaft verify` to detect drift or `coderaft apply` to reconcile — making environments shareable and auditable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Host File Access" icon="document">
    Your code stays on the host filesystem for easy editing with your favorite tools while running in isolated environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple Commands" icon="rocket">
    Easy-to-use CLI with intuitive commands for creating, managing, and working with development environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Templates & Configuration" icon="open-book">
    Project-specific coderaft.json configuration and built-in templates for Python, Node.js, Go, and web development.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Advanced Docker Features" icon="setting">
    Port mapping, volume mounting, environment variables, and resource limits for powerful, customizable environments.
